    </div>
    <div class='container content-padding'>
        <h2>How long does a full home inspection take?</h2>
        <p>A full home inspection typically depends on the size, age and condition of your home. An average inspection can take 2-4 hours. Additional time may be required if ancillary services are added to the standard full inspection.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container content-padding'>
        <h2>When can I expect to receive my report?</h2>
        <p>Reports will be sent within 24 hours to the client who has signed the inspection agreement. If you would like the report sent to anyone other than who signed the agreement, it must be requested in writing.

    </div>
    <div class='container content-padding'>
        <h2>Do I need to attend the inspection?</h2>
        <p>Although it is not necessary, we encourage and prefer that clients be present for inspections to observe and ask questions. The inspector will always make time to discuss the final report. In the case of a wind mitigation inspection, it is required that an adult at least 18 years of age be present.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container content-padding'>
        <h2>Can I ask questions during the inspection?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely! You may ask questions as the inspection is in progress or once the inspection is complete. The inspector has a lot to evaluate and most inspectors have a routine so that they do not overlook anything, so it is suggested to wait until the end of the inspection. Once the inspection is complete your inspector will summarize his findings. Questions can also be asked and answered once you review the final report.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='container content-padding'>

        <ul class='faq-ul'>
            <li>Have documentation of any updates and/or improvement performed on the house.</li>
            <li>The electrical, water and HVAC systems should be turned on prior to inspection.</li>
            <li>Your inspector is conducting a visual inspection, so access is important. Be sure to allow for total access, especially to key systems such as electrical panels, heating and cooling systems and attic spaces.</li>
            <li>If you have a pet please let the inspector know. Dogs should be secured in an area isolated from the inspection areas.</li>
        </ul>
